# About
This game is a mixture of elements from the games 'Tetris', and 'Minesweeper'.
It takes the major elements from tetris such as the blocks, controls, and mechanics,
and adds minesweeper elements to it, with blocks either being mines or safe blocks.

## How to play
* Use the arrow keys to control the block dropping (Space to hard drop)
* Use the mouse buttons to open blocks or flag them
