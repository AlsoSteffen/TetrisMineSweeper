# About
This game is a mixture of elements from the games 'Tetris', and 'Minesweeper'.
It takes the blocks, controls, and mechanics from tetris, and adds minesweeper 
elements to it, with blocks either being mines or safe blocks.

## How to play
* Use the arrow keys to control the block dropping (Space to hard drop)
* Use the mouse buttons to open blocks or flag them

## Information
As you play along, the game keeps track of your score and gets more difficult.
Make sure not to open a mine or let the blocks reach the top, or you explode!
